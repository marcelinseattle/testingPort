          <ol>
            <li><strong>Background and experiences</strong></li>
            <p>_I came from Brazil to US in 2005 to study English. While I was studying at Tacoma Community College, I was offered a job to work for Trader Joeâ€™s (I place that I love) and which I stayed for 9 years of my life. About a year ago I've started brain storming ideas to build a music application to connect local bands during their rehearsal. That was the beginning of my journey with programming</p>
            <li><strong>Hobbies and Skills</strong></li>
            <p>_I like playing the guitar, I love to sing Brazilian songs and I also love watching great movies.</p>
